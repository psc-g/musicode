This is the code for the performance at the end of the fourth episode.

The code itself is written in C++ with [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and you'll need the addons listed in the `addons.make` file.

You need to run `server.scd` in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) at the same time, as this is what handles the MIDI communication and note looping.
