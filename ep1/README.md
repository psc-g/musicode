This is the code for the performance at the end of the first episode.

To run it you need to also run [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) with the `midi_server.sc` file. This is used for MIDI communication with the Disklavier.

The code itself is written in C++ with [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and you'll need the addons listed in the `addons.make` file.
