A musical ode to musical code.

[Subscribe to the YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrZNf0XkxtXE0tsy1y2RT0w).

Each episode will explore a topic in Computer Science, a topic in Music, and combine them in creative ways.

You can find the code I use for each episode here!

The code itself is written in C++ with [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and you'll need the addons listed in the `addons.make` file.
